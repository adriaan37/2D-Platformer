Thank you for purchasing!


Instructions:
To get the most of these battlers you should set the SV attack images in your MV system to "none."
this will disable any default weapon images from showing up during attack motions.

There is a layered file provided with the largest resolution of the sheets for those who would like to try resize to higher resolutions.
The provided size is 2700x1200. that's 300x200 for each animation frame.

Helpful tips:
the "escape motion" on the battlers sheet can also be use as a forward dash motion if you
are designing elaborate movement during combat. This is easily achived with Yanfly's action sequence plugins.
I've attached my customized action sequence to serve as an example.


<setup action>
display action
immortal: targets, true
WAIT FOR ANIMATION
</setup action>

<Whole Action>
motion escape: user
move user: targets, front, 25
face user: home
wait: 24
face user: target
motion standby: user
wait for movement
</Whole Action>

<target action>
motion swing: user
wait: 15
attack animation: target
wait for motion
WAIT FOR ANIMATION
action effect
</target action>

<follow action>
face user: forward
jump user: 50, 25
move user: return, 25
motion escape: user
wait for movement
immortal: targets, false
</follow action>
